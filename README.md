# SupariStorefront 

## About this initiative 
The Supari Initiative is an initiative in which 3 programmers attempt to sell betel seeds to customers. The app will be written in flask, a python front-end web framework, and python for the back-end (yes, this whole app is built in python... Don't @ us). 

This app is an attempt to assemble our expertise to train our skills. More accurately, this could be described as an outlet for us to explore various technologies and to learn to better collaborate in a team setting.
